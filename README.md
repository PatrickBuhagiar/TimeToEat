# TimeToEat
This was an assignment for Service Oriented Architecture module, where we had to implement a food ordering and delivery system from scratch. I used a microserive approach, using Spring-Boot and Spring-Cloud technologies (Data, Security, Rest, Eureka, Feign and Ribbon) and Java8.

I'd recommend using IntelliJ as your editor. 

Please take a look at the TimeToEat Documentation pdf file for more details and instructions.
